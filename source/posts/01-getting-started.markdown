## What is squido?

`squido` is a dead simple static website builder which can be hosted anywhere for super fast websites and very little effort.

The idea is to be a `no code` setup and have everything you need to run and host a website. You simply do the writing and customization of style and layout. 

## Installation

Simply install the `squido` cli module globally in order to build and manage your static site.

With npm
``` bash
npm install -g squido
```

Or with Yarn
``` bash
yarn global add squido
```

Make your website directory:
``` bash
mkdir my-squido-website
```

Enter your new website directory:
``` bash
cd my-squido-website
```
